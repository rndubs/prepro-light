The PLAN.md file includes a list of objectives I wish to implement.
Each task should be performed on a separate branch.
Before creating a new branch, ensure that all changes on `main` have been pulled.

After implementing changes as outlined in the PLAN.md file, always review the PLAN.md contents and check off items that have been completed.

The RESEACH.md file includes additional context about the app motivation and design decisions.
If needed, please reference the RESEARCH.md file to build more context about a specific task in the PLAN.md file.
